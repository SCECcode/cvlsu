SSIP Coachella Valley model provides P-wave velocities for the shallow 
crust in the northern Salton Trough. The model combines travel-time 
observations from explosions recorded during the Salton Seismic Imaging 
Project (SSIP) with local earthquake recordings. The model extends from
the surface to 9-km depth.
